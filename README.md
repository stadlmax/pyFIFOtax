# pyFIFOtax
Simple Tax Reporting Tool for share transactions on foreign exchanges

# Data Sources
A tax report is generated in an automated fashion based on two sources of inputs
- a history of transactions including deposits and sales of shares, dividend payments, currency conversions to EUR, and all relevant fees in the process (see `example/transactions.xlsx` for details)
- a history of all relevant exchange rates (`eurofxref-hist.csv`, based on official reference rates from [EZB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.de.html)), in an updated version of this code, the latest rates are automatically downloaded

For the history of transactions, you don't have to bother about converting to EUR or matching the sell prices to the buy prices for instance. This is part of the automated reporting. Simply list the raw data. 

For the reference rates, you might have to download a newer version depending on your report year, depending on the version of your code. While it would be possible to have a variety of different foreign currencies based on this data, it is currently mainly intended in combination with USD.

NOTE: an update extends the functionality of the reporting scripts (including support for stock splits and automated suggestions for AWV reporting). As this breaks the way input data is defined, these things are only available once you have created a new list of transactions following this new format, see e.g. `examples/transactions.xlsx` as an example for this new format. The old format is still available. However, it won't produce AWV reports and it can't handle stock splits.

# Stock Splits
Over time, many companies will announce stock splits to reduce the price of their shares. Typical splits mean that for one existing share, you will receive a certain number of additional shares, e.g. 1, 3 ,or 9 in 2:1, 4:1, or 10:1 splits. NVDA, however, itself also had "odd" splits in the past, e.g. a 3:2 split, i.e. you received one additional share for two existing ones or half a share for one existing share. Technically, also reverse splits are possible, e.g. for two existing shares you will have one share after the split.

To keep track of these splits, fill out the sheet `stock_splits` in your transaction spreadsheet by adding the symbol of asset for which the split should be tracked, the date, and the number of shares after the split. For instance, a 4:1 split is denoted as 4.0, a 3:2 split would be denoted as 1.5. Leaving this file empty (but keeping the header) will lead to no splits applied. `ReportData` also has now an additional boolean flag to toggle this behavior (`apply_stock_splits`) even if the file is filled with some content. 

A stock split is assumed to take place after hours. I.e. if a stock split takes place on the 4th of August, any shares bought on that day will be assumed to split the next day. Any shares sold on this day, are seen as not having undergone the split.

NOTE: If you manually kept track of stock splits in the past in your list of transactions, please aware that these splits would be applied on top of your manual bookkeeping. Please check whether these calculations are done correctly.

# ESPP and RSUs
Shares coming from ESPPs or RSU lapses can be treated differently. With ESPP often being sold directly after they are bought, it could actually reduce the reporting burden as one wouldn't expect capital gains from these transactions. If users want to do so, they should indicate the separate treatment by noting down the shares with a different symbol in all relevant transactions, e.g. by using `NVDA-ESPP` and `NVDA-RSU` instead of only `NVDA`. The reporting then will separate them in different calculations. 

# Currencies, FOREX, and Deposits
The reporting tool will create FIFO queues of Foreign Currencies (i.e. not EUR) and a balance of EUR. These are also used e.g. for stock transactions and implicit currency events. To ensure that e.g. buy transactions are properly tracked based on initial balances and that currency related events are properly tracked after withdrawals, the tool can work on a provided list of currency movements in EUR or a foreign currency.
- for deposits, indicate the initial buy date of the foreign currency
- for withdrawals, set the amount as negative value indicating the outflow of money
- buy_date only has to be set for deposits of foreign currency, not for movements of EUR and not for withdrawals in general

# Report Generation
`create_report.py` will generate the report for you. Usage:
```
python3 create_report.py -dir <sub_dir of inputs/outputs> -f <file name of the transaction history> -y <report year> -o <output file name> -m <kind of exchange rates>
```
Note that the filenames should be valid Excel files, e.g. `transactions.xlsx` as input and `report.xlsx` as output. 

For the reporting, you can choose conversion based on daily exchange rates (`-m daily`) or monthly averages (`-m monthly_avg`). Both should (no guarantee of correctness) be fine in terms of tax reporting. However, one should (no guarantee of correctness) be consistent across years. It might be just wise to choose it once and go for it in the following years. But note that it can actually make quite a difference.

The generated report will contain several sheets with details of the transactions matching sell and buy orders based on the FIFO principle and including the right conversion rates to EUR. The last sheet will contain a summary intended as guidance for ELSTER.

## AWV Reports
In an updated version of this code, Z4 and Z10 entries intended for reporting transactions exceeding 12_500 EUR to the Bunsdesbank are also created automatically. You will find the corresponding sheets "Z4" and "Z10" in `awv_report_<report_year>.xlsx`. Note: for now this is only supported for any transaction involving NVDA shares denoted in USD.

# Conversion from Schwab-JSON exports
Export the JSON in the desired date range from History > Transactions > Export and select the JSON format.

After downloading the history, run `converter_json.py`.
```
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i CSV_FILENAME, --csv CSV_FILENAME
                        CSV file from Interactive Brokers or Schwab
  -o XLSX_FILENAME, --xlsx XLSX_FILENAME
                        Output XLSX file
  --forex_transfer_as_exchange
                        If set, treats outgoing wire transfers as currency exchange to EUR. This can be helpful to simplify the reporting of currency
                        conversions if this is the only style of transfer. Please check the actual date of conversion and for correctness in general!
```

Always inspect the results manually and copy only those values into the final spreadsheet which are verified!

After inspection and curation of your actual list of transactions, you can run the usual report creation scripts.

Note the following limitations:
* To simplify things, any wire transfer is assumed to be an outgoing transfer to an account denoted in EUR and thus implicitly is assumed to be a currency exchange. If this is not the case or if the date of the transfer does not match the settlement date, please delete or correct the corresponding entries.
* Schwab CSV converter was not tested with a fully upgraded account
* Buy orders are currently not supported.


## Interactive Brokers [potentially legacy]

The following has to be done once on the IBKR web interface:

1. Go to _Performance & Reports_ â†’ _Statements_
2. Create a new _Custom Statement_
3. Specify "pyFIFOtax CSV export" as _Statement Name_
4. In Sections select _All_
5. In _Section Configurations_ set all to _No_
6. Set _Format_ to _CSV_, _Period_ to _Daily_, and the language to _English_
7. Save it

Export the CSV file by running this newly created custom statement in the desired date range, then start the `converter.py` script with argument `ibkr`.

Always thoroughly examine the result.

By default, the "symbol" column contains the ticker name. If you'd like to see the ISIN there instead, use the `--ticker-to-isin` flag.

Note the following limitations:

* IBKR export format is very extensive, it's possible that some rows are not processed. Always verify the results
* Tax withholding calculation is not supported for dividends. Withheld tax will always be zero.

# Further Use
Since all the reporting is done in a very simple and quite naive Python implementation, one could easily use it to augment the data in other ways. `notebook_example.ipynb` for instance shows you how to retrieve certain results as `pd.DataFrame`.

# Requirements
- pandas
- XlsxWriter

# Testing

If you develop a new feature or change an existing piece of code, test your changes with the following command:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```
